# UFO_Challenge
## Overview
The purpose of this challenge is to further develop Dana's UFO sightings webpage by providing its users with a more in-depth analysis. Our changes will allow for users to filter multiple criteria simultaneously. We will be using JavaScript, HTML, CSS and D3.js to create a web application. 

## Results
The webpage will now allow users to search UFO sightings by date, city, state, country and shape- along with providing a brief description of the sighting.

## Summary
Using JavaScript, HTML, CSS and D3.js we were able to make Dana's UFO sightings webpage more engaging and user friendly. By adding table filters such as city and shape we were able to provide a more detailed way for users to seach for their sightings. One drawback to the webpage is that it doesn't incorporate enough historical data, it only contains sightings from 2010. One recommendation for further development would be to include a wider range of available dates. Another would be to include any relevant news articles or images associated with the sightings.
